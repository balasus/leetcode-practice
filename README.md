# Coding Practice
This is initial version of my coding practice by reading and understanding the data structures and algorithms and spending some 
time to think and write the solutions for the problems that I come across in LeetCode.
This will have my frequent 'coding time spent' on daily basis and will be uploaded to remote repo here.  
Please feel free to add your comments and suggestions
